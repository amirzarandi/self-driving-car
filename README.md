# Self-Driving Car Simulation

A self-driving car simulation that employs neural network-based techniques, particularly reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning. The neural network demonstrates proficiency in obstacle avoidance and optimal travel time estimation between destinations. The project showcases expertise in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Neural network-based self-driving car simulation.
- Obstacle avoidance using reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning.
- Optimal travel time estimation between destinations.
- Ability to draw obstacles for the car to avoid.
- Saving and reloading neural network models for specific obstacle courses.

## Files

- **map.py**: The main script containing the self-driving car simulation logic, obstacle handling, and interaction with the neural network AI.
- **car.kv**: The Kivy language file for defining the graphical user interface (GUI) layout.
- **ai.py**: Script containing the implementation of the neural network architecture, experience replay, and deep Q-learning algorithm.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirzarandi/self-driving-car
   cd self-driving-car
   ```

### Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash

```
Copy code
python map.py
The GUI window will open, displaying the self-driving car simulation.
Use the left mouse button to draw obstacles on the map.
Observe the self-driving car's behavior in avoiding obstacles and reaching its destination.
Documentation
